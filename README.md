# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This project takes a user's input on their team and turns it into a profile of their team.  It asks for the Manager's name along with their id#, email address, and office phone number.  The application then asks if you would like to add an Engineer or an Intern to your team.  If Engineer is selected, then it will ask you for their name, work id#, email address, and github user name.  Likewise, if Intern is selected, it will also ask for their name, work id#, email address and the school that they attend.  The application will allow you to add as many team members as you would like. When finished, press 'N' to stop the application from running and the HTML will be generated automatically to show you your entire team.
